Product Name
FARMA
Farmer’s Agriculture Recommendation & Monitoring Assistant
________________________________________
1. Product Overview
1.1 Product Description
FARMA is a multilingual, voice-enabled Android mobile application (APK) designed to help farmers make confident, explainable, and risk-aware farming decisions before planting.
The application acts as a conversational farming assistant that collects farmer inputs, analyzes Indian agricultural datasets, and provides clear crop recommendations, risk awareness, and planning guidance in the farmer’s preferred language — both as text and audio.

2. Problem Statement
Farmers often face crop losses due to:
•	Wrong crop selection for their soil and season
•	Unpredictable climate conditions
•	Lack of timely and localized agricultural guidance
•	Limited access to expert advice in rural areas
Most existing solutions are:
•	Too complex
•	Not region-specific
•	Not language-friendly
•	Not usable for small and medium-scale farmers
________________________________________
3. Solution Statement
FARMA addresses these challenges by providing a simple, explainable, and decision-focused farming assistant that:
•	Understands the farmer’s land, soil, season, and region
•	Uses real Indian agricultural data
•	Explains why a crop is suitable
•	Highlights risks and alternatives
•	Communicates in the farmer’s own language and voice

7.4 Context-Aware Input Collection
FARMA collects:
•	📍 Location (district/state, GPS or manual)
•	🌱 Soil type (manual or inferred)
•	📅 Season or month
•	📏 Land area (acres/hectares)
•	💧 Irrigation availability
These inputs are used to build a farmer context profile.
________________________________________
7.5 Crop Recommendation Engine (AI-Assisted)
•	Uses Indian agricultural datasets
•	Ranks top 2–3 suitable crops
•	Considers:
o	Soil compatibility
o	Season suitability
o	Regional performance
o	Land size impact
________________________________________
7.6 Explainable Recommendations
For each crop:
•	Why it is suitable
•	Expected yield range (approximate, land-based)
•	Water requirement level
•	Risk level (Low / Medium)
________________________________________
7.7 Risk Awareness Module (Differentiator)
•	Provides early risk indicators before planting
•	Based on:
o	Soil compatibility
o	Seasonal stability
o	Climate patterns
Purpose:
Help farmers avoid high-risk decisions before investing.
________________________________________
7.8 What-If Decision Support (Differentiator)
•	Farmer can compare alternative crops under the same context
•	Displays:
o	Suitability
o	Water needs
o	Risk differences
This is decision support, not full simulation.
________________________________________
7.9 Fertilizer Guidance (High-Level Advisory)
•	Provides basic fertilizer type guidance (e.g., NPK / organic)
•	Based on crop and soil type
•	Avoids dosage-level precision claims
Purpose:
Reduce misuse and promote awareness.
